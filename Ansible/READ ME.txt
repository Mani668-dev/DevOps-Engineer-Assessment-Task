Ansible Automation for Docker, Git, and Jenkins Setup

This project contains Ansible playbooks to automate the installation of:

--- Docker (docker_install.yml)
--- Git (git_install.yml)
--- Jenkins (jenkins_install.yml)

Each playbook is designed to run on **Amazon Linux 2** EC2 instances, providing a fully automated CI/CD-ready environment.

---

##  Prerequisites

- Ansible installed on your control node
- EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2
- SSH access to the instance (key file)
- A properly configured Ansible inventory file

---
How to Use

1. **Create/Update your inventory file:**

   Example (`hosts`):
   ```ini
   [servers]
   ec2_instance ansible_host=<your-ec2-ip> ansible_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
   
Run each playbook:

ansible-playbook docker_install.yml
ansible-playbook git_install.yml
ansible-playbook jenkins_install.yml

After Execution : 
Docker will be running and usable with sudo or directly (if the user is added to the docker group)
Git will be installed for version control.
Jenkins will be running on port 8080.
  example : http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080
  Open port 8080 in your EC2 security group to access Jenkins via browser
